investigate how to maintain the interactivity and consistency of a large-scale,
highly interactive media environment under the constraints of large network
latency and huge resource demands. Three fundamental problems, namely, the

design some computationally efficient approximation algorithms to solve these
problems. </p>

all areas of science and engineering and an increasingly complex simulation
system often requires huge computing resources and data sets that are
geographically distributed. The advent of grid technologies enable the use of
distributed computing resources and facilitate the access of geographically
distributed data. However, High Level Architecture (HLA) for modeling and
simulation, and grid computing <span class=GramE>have</span> been developed
separately. The first attempt to combine HLA and Grid technologies was based on
non-standard grid protocols. The main aim of this project is to develop a
framework to manage large-scale, Grid-enabled HLA-based simulations using the
proposed Open Grid Service Architecture standard. A major deficiency of HLA is
that it does not provide any mechanisms for managing the resources where the
simulation is being simulated. To support the execution of large HLA-based
distributed simulations over the Grid, we propose to address this deficiency by
developing the following additional services: dynamic naming services, load
management services, and fault-tolerant services. </p>

system, loss of time of the military personnel who underwent the training and,
worst of all, wrong decision-making. As a fundamental problem for all
distributed systems, consistency is especially important for large scale
distributed virtual training environments. This research supports the development
of distributed virtual training environments that offer an improved <span
class=SpellE>QoT</span> by minimizing inconsistencies in the simulation
applications. In a large scale distributed virtual training environment, due to
message transmission delay over the network and clock asynchrony among
different simulation nodes, a consistent view among different participants is
not guaranteed automatically, and various inconsistencies may thus occur. In
this project, two types of consistency problems are studied: causality
violation and time-space inconsistency – a unique consistency problem of large
scale distributed virtual environments. To eliminate causality violations, a
causality-based Time Management (TM) mechanism will be developed. To tackle the
time-space inconsistency problem, a metric, a model and the protocol associated
with the model will be investigated. In addition, a middleware solution for
implementing the TM mechanism and the protocol will also be developed. </p>

Chain Optimization through the adoption of HLA standard, several technical
issues are addressed in this project: a) Sensitive data encapsulation and
protection - the HLA standard does not provide any form of security mechanism

protects the data exchanges among participants. b) Reliability - the HLA
standard does not address the fault-tolerance issue of simulation. Multiple
simulations running at different locations are liable to failure (for example
network failure). c) Synchronization - the HLA standard has addressed the issue
on synchronizing the time advancement of each simulation module (federate). d)
Simulation cloning - simulation is a technique for performing
&quot;what-if&quot; analysis. Having the ability to spawn off a simulation from
a decision point to evaluate alternative scenarios is crucial to improve the
productivity of using simulation for analysis. e) Web enabled visualization and
